Points accessed through increment/decrement/++/-- are
now synonymous with stockgame monies.
---
In addtion, the dice game affects points: the winner
gets their final score added to their points/cash, all
losers get their final score likewise deducted. This
is untested, so expect breakage.

To usher in this new dystopian economy, some changes:
++/-- now select between 1 and 10,000, instead of a
100,000. Incrementing yourself is an instant -100,000. jcb
is no longer banned. This is all pretty insecure, so script
away if you must.
---
I also reset everybody's cash to $100,000. If you really
want your previous gains back, make a formal request. Please
request an amount of money smaller than worldwide GDP, grains
of sand on the beach, number of atoms in the universe, etc.
