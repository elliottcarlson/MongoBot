# Random thoughts and future TODO list:

## Glossolalia:

- AMPR interface with AMPRNet Protal IP block, and Mongo's own HAM license
- ICECast interface for hearing commands output being played back -- or a
  channel run music station? or both?

## Other

- Keybase integration
- D&D 5e Alignments to dictate how MongoBot behaves
